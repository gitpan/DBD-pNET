Why the test suite doesn't work.
--------------------------------

DBD::pNET is in an alpha stage, but the least supported part is definitely
the test suite. This has two reasons:

  - DBI is still too incomplete. A true test suite would need features
    which are (from the current view of DBI) not portable, for example
    finding a nonexisting table where one can work, an abstract table
    definition or the possibility to retrieve column types. The result
    is the lack of a true DBI test suite and this is exactly what a
    portable test suite for DBD::pNET would requite.

  - I do not have the possibility nor the time to try DBD::pNET versus
    other drivers, sorry.

Thus I'll be glad about anyone who adapts the test suite to work with
other remote drivers than mysql. To do this you have to know, how the
test suite works:

  1.) First of all you need a client configuration file. You get one
      by executing the test "t/00base.t". Try the command

	perl -Iblib/lib -Iblib/arch t/00base.t

      You should modify the variables $test_dsn, $test_user and
      $test_password in "t/lib.pl" and rerun "t/00base.t" until you
      think that the file "t/clients" is ok now.

  2.) Next you need a running pNETagent. I have tried to use the concept
      of the pRPC test suite and start a server from within lib.pl, but
      it turned out that repeatedly starting and shutting down the server
      resulted in a lack of stability. So you have to start the server
      manually. You do this with the command

	./pNETagent --debug --port 3334 --configFile t/clients

  3.) Now you must modify "t/lib.pl" so that it enables all tests, not
      only "t/00base.t". Look for the "DBI->connect" in "t/lib.pl"
      where the test suite checks for a running mysql server and
      change this to a check for your server.

That's all I can help so far. I am ready to assist in case of problems.
In either case, please modify "t/lib.pl" only (whereever possible) and
let me know about the results.


Thanks,

NAME
    DBD::pNET - Perl network database driver for the DBI module

    pNETagent - DBI proxy server

SYNOPSIS
    use DBI;
    $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:pNET:hostname=$host:port=$port:dsn=$db",
                        $user, $passwd);
    # See the DBI module documentation for full details

    pNETagent --port <port> [other options]

DESCRIPTION
    DBD::pNET is a Perl module for connecting to a database via a remote DBI
    driver. This is of course not needed for DBI drivers which already
    support connecting to a remote database, but there are DBI drivers which
    work with local databases only, for example DBD::ODBC.

    pNETagent is the DBI proxy server usually running on the same machine
    than the DBMS. It may run on other machines, if the DBMS itself supports
    access over the network. This can be useful in a firewalled environment.

    pNETagent supports security features like host and user based
    authorization, encryption and query restrictions: You can create a
    set of queries that the client may execute and restrict access to
    these. Again, this is of special importance in a firewalled
    environment.

REQUIREMENTS
    DBD::pNET is based on the pRPC-modules (Perl RPC) a package for aiding
    the development of Perl based client/server applications. You find the
    this module on any CPAN mirror, for example

	ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/JWIED

    pRPC is in turn is based on the "Storable" module. This is available
    from CPAN too, see

	ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/languages/perl/CPAN/authors/id/RAP

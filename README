NAME
    DBD::pNET - Perl network database driver for the DBI module

    pNETagent - DBI proxy server

SYNOPSIS
    use DBI;
    $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:pNET:hostname=$host:port=$port:dsn=$db",
                        $user, $passwd);
    # See the DBI module documentation for full details

    pNETagent --port <port> [other options]

DESCRIPTION
    DBD::pNET is a Perl module for connecting to a database via a remote DBI
    driver. This is of course not needed for DBI drivers which already
    support connecting to a remote database, but there are DBI drivers which
    work with local databases only, for example DBD::ODBC.

    pNETagent is the DBI proxy server usually running on the same machine
    than the DBMS. It may run on other machines, if the DBMS itself supports
    access over the network. This can be useful in a firewalled environment.

REQUIREMENTS
    DBD::pNET is based on the pRPC-modules (Perl RPC) a package for aiding
    the development of Perl based client/server applications. At the time
    of this writing this isn't available on the CPAN, but on

	ftp://ftp.neckar-alb.de/pub/users/wiedmann/pRPC-modules-0.1.tar.gz

    only. Hopefully this will change soon.

    pRPC is in turn is based on version 0.6 of the "Storable" module.
    This is mainly the latest official distribution with some enhancements
    I added, in particular encryption and an object oriented API. The
    author, Raphael Manfredi has agreed that he will distribute a new
    version with the enhancements included, but currently the only
    source is

      ftp://ftp.neckar-alb.de/pub/users/wiedmann/Storable-0.6.tar.gz
